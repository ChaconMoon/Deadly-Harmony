    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5
    m_Localized: It's okay, it's good rock for once. Although giving it in a nightclub
      has something to do with it...

    m_Localized: 'Hey Carlos, that rocker on stage isn''t bad, right? '

    m_Localized: Isn't this the news guy who defrauded the Treasury of 200 thousand
      euros?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 10
    m_Localized: You say it as if you are surprised that an artist defrauds the Treasury.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

      for the trial, classify the clues there for me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 19
    m_Localized: And the posters were posted on the windows of the office, well I
      said why not?

      would be here giving the concert today.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

  - m_Id: 27
    m_Localized: 'It is a unique opportunity to analyze the acoustics of the place.
      It is perfect for the new thesis I am developing. '
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 28
    m_Localized: Have you considered how sound waves disperse in such a wide environment
      and how that affects our perception of sound?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 29
    m_Localized: 'Well, not really. I''m more worried about how the crowd is going

      and estimate how much living space we have. '

  - m_Id: 56
    m_Localized: Either you pay, or I tell your dear little princess that the charity
      event is just a lie and that the money is for your personal use.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 57
    m_Localized: That's a lie and you know it! I would never lie to Tiffany. The
      money is only for your organization.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 58
    m_Localized: But she doesn't know that. Either you pay or I tell him that it's
      all a ruse on your part to keep half of the money you get from the concert.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 59

    m_Localized: Hey, we have a problem! The old man has had a potato attack or what
      do I know!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 65
    m_Localized: And those screams? Carlos, I think something has happened to Alex.

      serious.
    m_Metadata:

  - m_Id: 71
    m_Localized: We were talking, I accidentally got hot and went to grab him by
      the neck to make him shut up.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 72
    m_Localized: But I swear I didn't have time to squeeze my hands too hard to kill
      him!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73
    m_Localized: 'When I realized it, the old man already had blood in his mouth
      and was not breathing. '

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 82
    m_Localized: You, yes you, the one who is passing my dialogues without rhyme
      or reason.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 83
    m_Localized: When we investigate the scene and question witnesses...

    m_Localized: Wait... this is a toupee?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Carlos, are you kidding me? Pfffhaha... *wipes a tear*
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: You have obtained Fernando's toupee, YUCK!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 89
    m_Localized: Have you noticed this Carlos?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 90
    m_Localized: What's going on?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 91
    m_Localized: Look closely, doesn't your neck look strange to you?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 92
    m_Localized: Now that you mention it... Fernando's body has no marks on his neck.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 93
    m_Localized: What Alex Caster said seems to be true. He has no signs of strong
      strangulation.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 94
    m_Localized: Nor does he have self-defense scratches with his nails trying to
      free himself. How curious...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 95
    m_Localized: '"Marks on Neck" has been added to the notebook.'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 96
    m_Localized: What a grotesque scene, poor man.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 97
    m_Localized: His whole mouth is covered in blood, whatever it is, it looks quite
      painful.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 98
    m_Localized: But it doesn't seem to show signs of axiphysia, I doubt that the
      blood has anything to do with the lungs.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 99
    m_Localized: There are also no wounds on the lips or inside the mouth, it is
      most likely that he coughed and that blood came from the stomach.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 100
    m_Localized: If you notice, there are droplets of blood on his sleeve, so the
      idea that he coughed up blood seems the most plausible to me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 101
    m_Localized: Added "Blood Stains" to the notebook
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 102
    m_Localized: Fernando's profile has been added to the profile menu
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 103
    m_Localized: It is clear that the person who did it is someone present here,
      since that guy was alive before entering this room.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 104
    m_Localized: Do you think it could have been Caster?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 105
    m_Localized: Unfortunately, the two of them entered this room and only one of
      them has come out alive...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 106
    m_Localized: I think we should question the rest of the people in the other room.
      Some of them have to know the victim.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 107
    m_Localized: Removing the victim there are only 5 people left, with Alex there
      are 6.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 108
    m_Localized: Earlier I saw the victim talking to a girl, we should start with
      her. But first let's talk to Caster.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 109
    m_Localized: What have you found out?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Alex...He's dead.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 111
    m_Localized: That? As? If I didn't kill him.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 112
    m_Localized: We believe the cause of death was not strangulation.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 113
    m_Localized: Are you sure you didn't do anything to him?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 114
    m_Localized: Of course not. I didn't like him, but I wouldn't kill him either.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 115
    m_Localized: The only thing we know is that you two went in and only one came
      out alive.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 116
    m_Localized: I could tell you exactly what happened.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 117
    m_Localized: Clear...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: The victim is a tax agent who wanted to blackmail me by telling
      my ex that I was going to keep the money from the concert.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 119
    m_Localized: My ex is the owner of the organization to which I was going to donate
      the money and I wanted her to see that I am a good person.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 120
    m_Localized: She has come as an audience, you can talk to her.

    m_Localized: The only woman here is the one who was with the victim.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: Very suspicious indeed.
    m_Metadata:
